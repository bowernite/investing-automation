# Investing Automation

Generates JS I can run in the browser, to automate the process of investing and/or rebalancing my portfolio.

Specifically, queries the page to find out how much money we have, current value of positions, and then spits out instructions for what to buy and sell in order to acheive the desired portfolio ratios.
